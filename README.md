# Hamilton Hotline

Inspired by [Grandma Party Hotline](http://www.grandmapartyhotline.com)

This was part of a [DemoCamp Hamilton](http://www.softwarehamilton.com/democamp/democamphamilton10/).

I will push the remainder of the code once I have removed the embedded credentials.

# What does HH do?
It provides a phone number for an end-user to call. The recording is then listed on the site.
